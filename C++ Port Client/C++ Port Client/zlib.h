/*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in case of corrupted input.

     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped
   to zero.  It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out has dropped
   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h).  WARNING: On MSDOS, pointers
   returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must* have their
   offset normalized to zero.  The default allocation function provided by this
   library ensures this (see zutil.c).  To reduce memory requirements and avoid
   any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio, compile
   the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source

   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

/*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than inflate() for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the
   allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only
   the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the normal
   behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error
   in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature
   of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.
   In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished
   using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.  If
   strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning
   non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is
   assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack()
   cannot return Z_OK.

   an interface similar to that of stdio, using the functions that start with
   "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a gzip
   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
*/

typedef voidp gzFile;       /* opaque gzip file descriptor */

/*
ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen OF((const char *path, const char *mode));

     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.) Also "a"
   can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will be
   written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since reading
   and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
*/

ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzdopen OF((int fd, const char *mode));
/*
     gzdopen associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File descriptors
   are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or fileno (if the file
   has been previously opened with fopen).  The mode parameter is as in gzopen.

     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the file
   descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor
   fd.  If you want to keep fd open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd,
   mode);.  The duplicated descriptor should be saved to avoid a leak, since
   gzdopen does not close fd if it fails.

     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate the
   gzFile state, if an invalid mode was specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not
   provided, or '+' was provided), or if fd is -1.  The file descriptor is not
   used until the next gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so gzdopen
   will not detect if fd is invalid (unless fd is -1).

     Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions.  The
   default buffer size is 8192 bytes.  This function must be called after
   gzopen() or gzdopen(), and before any other calls that read or write the
   file.  The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or
   write.  Two buffers are allocated, either both of the specified size when
   writing, or one of the specified size and the other twice that size when
   reading.  A larger buffer size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will
   noticeably increase the speed of decompression (reading).

     The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf().

     gzbuffer() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, such as being called
   too late.

/*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.  If
   the input file was not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
   bytes into the buffer.

     After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input, gzread will continue
   to read, looking for another gzip stream, or failing that, reading the rest
   of the input file directly without decompression.  The entire input file
   will be read if gzread is called until it returns less than the requested
   len.

     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than

   uncompressed bytes written is limited to 8191, or one less than the buffer
   size given to gzbuffer().  The caller should assure that this limit is not
   exceeded.  If it is exceeded, then gzprintf() will return an error (0) with
   nothing written.  In this case, there may also be a buffer overflow with
   unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if zlib was compiled with
   the insecure functions sprintf() or vsprintf() because the secure snprintf()
   or vsnprintf() functions were not available.  This can be determined using
   zlibCompileFlags().

   condition is encountered.  If any characters are read or if len == 1, the
   string is terminated with a null character.  If no characters are read due
   to an end-of-file or len < 1, then the buffer is left untouched.

     gzgets returns buf which is a null-terminated string, or it returns NULL
   for end-of-file or in case of error.  If there was an error, the contents at
   buf are indeterminate.

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gzflush OF((gzFile file, int flush));
/*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file.  The parameter flush

     If the flush parameter is Z_FINISH, the remaining data is written and the
   gzip stream is completed in the output.  If gzwrite() is called again, a new
   gzip stream will be started in the output.  gzread() is able to read such
   concatented gzip streams.

     gzflush should be called only when strictly necessary because it will

ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzseek OF((gzFile file,

     Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream.  The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2);
   the value SEEK_END is not supported.

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow.  If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

     gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position

   includes the count of bytes that precede the gzip stream, for example when
   appending or when using gzdopen() for reading.  When reading, the offset
   does not include as yet unused buffered input.  This information can be used

   just like feof(), gzeof() may return false even if there is no more data to
   read, in the event that the last read request was for the exact number of
   bytes remaining in the input file.  This will happen if the input file size
   is an exact multiple of the buffer size.

     If gzeof() returns true, then the read functions will return no more data,
   unless the end-of-file indicator is reset by gzclearerr() and the input file
   has grown since the previous end of file was detected.

/*
     Returns true (1) if file is being copied directly while reading, or false

   false to true while reading the input file if the end of a gzip stream is
   reached, but is followed by data that is not another gzip stream.

     If the input file is empty, gzdirect() will return true, since the input
   does not contain a gzip stream.

     If gzdirect() is used immediately after gzopen() or gzdopen() it will
   cause buffers to be allocated to allow reading the file to determine if it

   gzclose must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free
   must not be called more than once on the same allocation.

   using these instead of gzclose() is that they avoid linking in zlib
   compression or decompression code that is not used when only reading or only
   writing respectively.  If gzclose() is used, then both compression and
   decompression code will be included the application when linking to a static
   zlib library.

   Z_ERRNO and the application may consult errno to get the exact error code.

     The application must not modify the returned string.  Future calls to
   this function may invalidate the previously returned string.  If file is
   closed, then the string previously returned by gzerror will no longer be

   much faster.
