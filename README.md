# Remote-Manager
Project from Late 2009 to early 2010.
Initally built to be malware but lets just call it "remote" management.
It used a lot of MSDN api's. 
I left the code as it was back in 2010, debug lines and all. 

Featured:
* Server + Client model
* Commands could be sent to the client. 
* Client window can be stealthed.
* Featured remote command line execution. 
* Featured it's own "VNC" (can only send mouse clicks and view clients desktop).
    - You can set quality of VNC (it's basically set quality of jpg screen caps). 
    - It also claims to beable to use multiple sockets for the image streaming.

 


Topics - Networking, Threading, Pipes
